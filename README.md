# CMDE-Ass5-Laplace-partial-differential-equation
Implement finite difference method scheme/program for solving Laplace partial differential equation ( 2T = 0) with Diritchlet boundary conditions and using following approaches: 1. Gauss Seidel Method 2. Alternative direction Implicit


Use following example for demonstration and comparison of computation time:
Consider a plate of 2.4m x 3.0 m that is subjected to boundary condition as
shown in below figure. Find the temperature (T(x, y)) distribution inside this plate (on
grid points). You can consider a square grid of different sizes. Moreover create a surface
plot of the temperature distribution.

Note that:
1. Proper documentation should be used in the codes
2. You have to submit a program. Name of the file should be: “Ass5_EntryNu”
3. There will be evaluation of this assignment during some practical session, you will
be informed before.
4. Total Marks for this assignment = 4.
5. No cheating allowed.
